# ELLIE ESP32-S3 Breakoutboard

The "ESP32-S3 Breakoutboar" PCB's are ESP32-S3 breakoutboards. These boards to already exist but these custom ones have two main advantages over the "generic" ones:

1. These come with additional holes spaced at 1 mil or 2.56 mm, in these holes screw terminals can be soldered, aiding the ease of construction and maintainance of the Contour Wall.
2. Having a smaller footprint. The generic ones have a larger footprint, which would not fit in the electrical boxes.
