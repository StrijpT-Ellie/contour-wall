## Getting started

**This guide assumes the use of the "standard" [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)**, as this is the micro-controller designed to be used for the Contour Wall and this firmware. It will likely work on other MCU, but this is untested.

1. Install [Arduino IDE 2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Install ESP32 boards for IDE 2, see [RandomNerdTutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-esp32-arduino-ide-2-0/)
3. Install FastLED, see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED#getting-started)
4. Select board: `ESP32 Dev Module`, with the corresponding COM port
5. Upload sketch.
