# Getting started

If you want to incorperate the Contour Wall into your project you are going to have to decide on the language that you want to use. Currently, the two languages in which the library to control the wall is implemented are: Python and Rust. If you want to use a different language you are going to have to [implement it yourself](../CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-new-wrappers).

The documentation for the for the library that you are going to use can be found in their respective directory, which are all located in the [`wrappers/`](../lib/wrappers/) directory. All wrappers should have examples are guides on how to setup your development enviroment.
