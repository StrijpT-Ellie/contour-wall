# Getting started

If you want to incorperate the Contour Wall into your project you are going to have to decide on the language that you want to use. Currently, the two languages in which the library to control the wall is implemented are: Python and Rust. If you want to use a different language you are going to have to [implement it yourself](../CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-new-wrappers).

The documentation for the for the library that you are going to use can be found in their respective directory, which are all located in the [`wrappers/`](../lib/wrappers/) directory. All wrappers should have examples are guides on how to setup your development enviroment.

## Demo

A demo is a creative or technical experiment that you can display on Contour Wall. This could be a visual animation, interactive sensor-based experience, or any other digital interaction that fits the wall’s theme of interactivity. For example there are demo’s that work as mirrors by showing the contour or the person standing in front of the wall. But there are also game options such as a mario coin collecting demo or flappy bird.  

These demos serve as examples of what can be achieved with the wall. 

These demo’s are to be on the contour wall during school hours for visitors to interact with. The goal of these demo’s are to: 

- Experiment with new technologies and frameworks
- Showcase creativity and technical skills
- Learn how to build and integrate interactive systems

More information and examples can be found in the `/demos` folder.
